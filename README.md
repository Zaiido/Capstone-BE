## :dart: About

This backend server provides a RESTful API that is used by the frontend to perform various operations, such as creating and managing users, gardens, posts, and comments.

Authentication and authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Passport.js. Users can sign up for an account using their email, Google, or Facebook accounts. Once logged in, they can create and manage their profile, which includes information about their gardens, plants and posts.

The server also integrates with an API that provides plant identification and disease information. This API accepts images from users and uses machine learning algorithms to identify the plant species and detect any diseases it may have. This information is then provided back to the user, along with suggestions for treatment options.

To ensure data integrity and security, the server uses MongoDB as its primary database, and all data is encrypted using encryption algorithms. In addition, the server uses a variety of security measures, such as input validation, and error handling, to prevent attacks and ensure the stability and reliability of the system.

Overall, the backend server plays a critical role in the success of the project by providing a secure, and reliable platform for users to manage their gardens, share information, and get assistance with their plants.
